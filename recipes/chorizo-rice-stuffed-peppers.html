            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A great dinner with a bit of a kick! These can also be prepared a head of time without the cheese topping, so it's only a few minutes to melt and crisp the cheese in the broiler.</p>

            <!-- Step 3: Create "Ingredients" heading then have an UNORDERED LIST of ingredients -->

            <!-- Step 4: Create "Directions" heading then use an ORDERED LIST od the steps -->

            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
                <li>Add tomatoes, onion, carrot, celery, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, adobo, basil, and cilantro to the skillet with the chorizo. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add rice and simmer for 5 minutes more. Remove from heat, add fresh parsley, and let rest.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Stuff each poblano pepper half with the chorizo mixture; lay in the baking dish. Add water to the bottom of the dish. Loosely cover with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender but still firm, about 1 hour. Remove foil and sprinkle peppers with Cheddar, mozzarella, and pepper Jack cheeses.</li>
                <li>Turn on the broiler; broil peppers until cheese is brown and bubbly, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
