        <!-- Step 2: Create "Description" heading then have a <p> or 2 about the recipe -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A sweet treat that's a perfect way to end any meal or cooldown after a hot day! This makes a rather large serving so expect there to be leftovers if you're only making this for your family.</p>

        <!-- Step 3: Create "Ingredients" heading then have an UNORDERED LIST of ingredients -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix</li>

            <li>Â½ gallon chocolate ice cream, softened</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Step 4: Create "Directions" heading then use an ORDERED LIST od the steps -->
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare cake according to package directions; bake in a 9x13 inch baking dish and cool completely.</li>

            <li>Use ice cream that comes in a rectangular carton. Remove the carton and, using a piece of string or dental floss, cut the ice cream in half lengthwise (long side to long side) and place the two layers side by side on a piece of waxed paper.</li>

            <li>Place the cooled cake over the ice cream. Trim the cake and ice cream so that the edges match.</li>

            <li>Place a board or serving platter over the cake, hold onto the waxed paper and board, and flip the ice cream cake over. Remove the waxed paper and smooth out the seam between the ice cream slabs.</li>

            <li>Cover with waxed paper and freeze until very firm. Decorate as desired.</li>
        </ol>
